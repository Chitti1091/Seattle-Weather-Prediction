# Seattle-Weather-Prediction

The objective of this project, titled “Seattle Weather Prediction Using Regression Analysis,” is to develop a predictive model to forecast the maximum daily temperature (temp_max) in Seattle using historical weather data. By analyzing features such as minimum temperature (temp_min), precipitation, wind speed (wind), and weather type (weather), my aim to create an accurate and reliable model. This involves data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAPE. The goal is to use the model to predict future temperatures and support weather-related decision-making in Seattle.
